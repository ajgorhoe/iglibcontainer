The current branch is intended for checking out IGLib submodules by batch 
scripts (which must be run explicitly) instead of using submodules.

The branch should NOT BE MERGED into other main branches, and other main branches should not be merged into this one except dhe development branches 
to add features. For a list of main branches and their functionality, see 
0readme_IGLibContainer.txt .
