This is a container for IGLib's prescribed directory structure and contains
means for checking out the submodules.

Two different approaches are supported:
* Check out via batch scripts on the following main branches:
  * master
  * nomerge/checkout_with_batch_files
* Module check out via Git Submodules on the following main branches:
  * nomerge/checkout_via_submodules

The master bransh should be preferably used for checking out via batch 
scripts, although the two branches would be synchronized from time to time
and currently serve the same purpose.
