Remark:
Storing copies of these libraries outside the referencing repositories
enables easier sharing among repositories and separate updates during 
development. For example, such external libraries will be much more static
than the referencing libraries, therefore it is worth storing a referenced
copies that can be copied around locally (which is faster) when new loval 
copies of referencing repositories are needed (these will be updated from
repositories rather than copied locally.)
