WARNING: Do not include this directory as submodule!

Instead, directory should be checked out by the InitScript.bat script,
which must eexist in the directory containing the current directory. Its
copy is in copies/InitScript.bat.



REMARK:
This directory is now obsolete and will be slowly phased out.
Scripts from the directory will be replaced by scripts from the 
IGLibScripts module.
