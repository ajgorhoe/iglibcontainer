This directory contains copies of some scripts from the IGLibScripts
repository, which are used to botstrap the scripts necessary for updating
module repositories.

From time to time, these scripts will be updated. If there are breaking
changes in the original copies from IGLibScripts then other scripts 
involved in bootstrapping should be modified accordingly, and updating
modulles should be tested.
