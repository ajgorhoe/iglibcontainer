    <h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
    The IHLibScripts is an <i>IGLib</i> (<i>Investigation Generic
      Library</i>) module that contains some useful batch scripts and
    shell scripts used by the library (e.g. for managing repository
    cloning and updates). <br>
    Mainly these utilities are generally useful and their use is not
    limited to <i>IGLib</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="utilities"></a>Selected Utilities</h2>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="utilities_updaterepo"></a>UpdateRepo.bat</h3>
    Clones or updates a Git repository at particular location on the
    disk. Parameters of the operation are obtained from environment
    variables with a predefined meaning for this command. These
    variables are:<br>
    <blockquote><b><i>ModuleDir</i></b> - a directory into which the
      repository is cloned.<br>
      <b><i>CheckoutBranch</i></b> - branch that is checked out /
      switched to by the command. <br>
      <b><i>RepositoryAddress</i></b> - address of remote Git repository
      that is cloned into the <i>ModuleDir</i> or from which repository
      is updated (changes pulled).<br>
      <b><i>Remote</i></b> (optional, default is <i>origin</i>) - name
      of the main Git remote, corresponding to <i>RepositoryAddress</i>.
      All remote operations executed by this script will act on remote
      with this name.<br>
      <b><i>RepositoryAddressSecondary</i></b> (optional, default is
      undefined) - address of alternative remote repository. In case the
      script performs cloning of the repository (which is when the
      repository has not yet been cloned at the location specified by <i>ModuleDir</i>,
      or when that directory does not contain a valid Git repository),
      the secondary remote specified by <i>RemoteSecondary</i> will be
      defined on the cloned repository and linked tho this address.<br>
      <b><i>RemoteSecondary</i></b> (optional, default is <i>originsecondary</i>)
      - name of the secondary remote. If the script performs cloning of
      the repository at <i>RepositoryAddress</i> then&nbsp; it will
      assign the address <i>RepositoryAddressSecondary</i> to a remote
      named <i>RemoteSecondary</i>.<br>
      <i><b>RepositoryAddressLocal</b></i> (optinal, default is
      undefined) - an eventual additional alternative repository
      address, usually a local repository but not necessarily. Behavior
      is equivalent as for <i>RepositoryAddressSecondary</i> / <i>RemoteSecondary</i>:
      If the variable is defined and not an empty string, and the script
      also performs cloning (i.t., the repository is first cloned at the
      location <i>ModuleDir</i>), then the script also defines the
      remote named <i>RemoteLocal</i> <i></i>with this address.<br>
      <i><b>RemoteLocal</b></i> (optional, default is <i>local</i>) -
      name of the additional alternative origin whose address is set to
      the value of <i>RepositoryAddressLocal</i> if this variable is
      defined.<br>
      <br>
    </blockquote>
    <b>Usage</b>:<br>
    <blockquote><i>UpdateRepo.bat</i><br>
      <blockquote>Clones or updates the repository whose address, local
        checkout path, and other parameters are defined by the agreed
        environment variables mentioned above.<br>
        In order for this to work, environment variables that defines <b>parameters</b>
        of operation (repository cloning or updating) <b>must be set
          prior to calling the script</b> <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i>, and
        this is most often done by packing these definitions into a
        separate <i>settings script</i> and <i>calling</i> the script
        before calling <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i>. <br>
        The disadvantage of this approach is that the <i>settings
          script</i> will have side effects (environment variables set)
        in the context where <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i> is called, so
        whenever we want to call the script in this way, we must pollute
        the environment by setting the environment variables that carry
        operation parameters for the script. This can be avoided by
        calling the script in the second way, with <i>settings script</i>
        and its eventual arguments <i>specified as argumens to the </i><i>UpdateRepo



          call</i> (see the description below). In this way, the <i>settings



        </i><i>script</i> will is called recursively within the body of
        <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i>, enclosed in <i>setlocal / endlocal</i>
        block, which prevents propagation of side effects the caller's
        context.<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><i>UpdateRepo.bat EmbeddedCommand &lt;arg 1 arg 2
        ....&gt;</i><br>
      <blockquote>This will first call the <i>EmbeddedCommand</i> with
        eventual arguments (optional parameters <i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>,
        etc.), and then perform the repository update in the same manner
        as <i>UpdateRepo</i> called without arguments.<br>
        The <i>EmbeddedCommand</i> will typically be another batch <i>script



          that sets all the relevant environment variables</i> that
        define parameters for repository updating or cloning (see
        description of parameters via environment variables above).<br>
        The body of the <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i>&nbsp; script is <b>embedded



          in setlocal / endlocal</b> block, therefore any <b>side
          effects will not propagate to the caller environment</b>. This
        applies for side effects of <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i> as well as <i>EmbeddedCommand</i>.<br>
        It is desirable that <b><i>update setting scripts</i></b> (that
        set environment variables carrying parameters for repository
        updating operations), which are commonly specified as the <i>EmbeddedCommand</i>
        argument, are also defined in the way that they can take
        embedded command to be run (together with its arguments)
        specified via command-line arguments of the settings script. In
        this way, one can chain nested calls of useful commands or
        scripts that are called recursively before the main body of the
        <i>UpdateRepo</i> script is executed. This adds a great
        flexibility to the repository updating scripts while preventing
        the scripts from polluting the calling environment with
        environment variables that are necessary to carry update
        parameters to scripts. A typical use of this is passing to the <i>UpdateRepo</i>
        script a settings script, e.g. <i>SettingsIGLibScripts.bat, </i>which



        defines the necessary environment variables containing updating
        parameters such as local directory and remote address (in this
        example, for cloning / updating the IGLibScripts repository to a
        specified location by the specified remote repository). Then,
        with additional arguments, further commands can be passed to the
        <i>SettingsIGLibScripts</i> script, which would be executed
        recursively within <i>SettingsIGLibScripts.bat</i>, after the
        script main body that sets the environment variables. These
        further commands can for example modify some values set by the
        script, which enables <b>reusing the settings script</b>, but <b>with



          some updating parameters modified</b> (for example <b><i>ModuleDir</i></b>
        or <b><i>RepositoryAddressSecondary</i></b>) to achieve a bit
        different behavior. This can be achieved e.g. by the <i><b>SetVar.bat</b></i>
        script (see its description), which sets the specified
        environment variable. The (imaginary, assuming existence of
        the&nbsp; setting <i>SettingsIGLibScripts.bat</i> script)
        example command below would call the <i>UpdateRepo</i> script
        to update (or clone) the repository defined by parameters set by
        the <i>SettingsIGLibScripts</i> script, but overriding the
        values of the <b><i>ModuleDir</i></b> (defining the
        repository's local cloning directory) and the <b><i>CheckoutBranch</i></b>
        (defining the branch that is checked out by the <i>UpdateRepo</i>
        script):<br>
        <blockquote><i><u>UpdateRepo</u> "</i><i><i>D:\GitUser</i>\RepositorySettings\SettingsIGLibScripts.bat"&nbsp;



            <u>SetVar</u> ModuleDir "D:\GitUser\My Workspace" <u>SetVar</u>
            CheckoutBranch "release/1.9.1"<br>
          </i></blockquote>
        The .bat extensions in some script names were omitted in the
        above command, and scripts available in the <i>IGLibScripts</i>
        repository are underlined. To check out how this actually works
        in practice, refer to examples contained in &lt;<i>IGLibScripts</i>&gt;\examples_repos



        .<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <b>Operation</b>:<br>
    If<b> </b>the directory specified by&nbsp; does <b>not</b> contain
    <b>a valid Git repository</b>, the directory is first <b>removed</b>
    (recursively, including complete direcory structure). The script
    must therefore be used with some caution, please take care that <b><i>ModuleDir</i></b><b>
      does not point to a directory with useful content that is not a
      clone of the repository specified by <i>RepositoryAddre</i><i>ss</i></b>.
    <br>
    Then, if the directory specified by&nbsp;<b><i>ModuleDir</i></b>
    does <b>not exist</b>, the <b>repository at</b> the address <b><i>RepositoryAddress</i></b>
    is <b>cloned into </b><b><i>ModuleDir</i></b>. After cloning is
    complete, the <b>additional remotes are defined</b> on the cloned
    repository, provided that the corresponding addresses, <b><i>RepositoryAddressSecondary</i></b>
    or / and <i><b>RepositoryAddressLocal</b></i> are specified.
    Finally, the remote branch specified by <b><i>CheckoutBranch</i></b>
    is checked out and updated (pulled) from the main remote from which
    repository was cloned.<br>
    If the directory specified by <b><i>ModuleDir</i></b> <b>already
      contains a Git repository</b> then the script will only <b>make
      sure that the correct branch</b> (specified by <b><i>CheckoutBranch</i></b>)
    <b>is checked out</b> and will <b>update the branch</b> by pulling
    any changes <b>from the remote repository</b> (at <b><i>RepositoryAddress</i></b>).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Warning</b>: <br>
    When repository already exists (so it does not need to be cloned),
    the script will <b>not verify whether the repository contained in </b><b><b><i>ModuleDir</i></b>
      is the correct one and corresponds to the remote repository at </b><b><b><i>RepositoryAddress</i></b></b>.
    Performing&nbsp; such a check would require execution of additional
    scripts (such scripts may be provided in the future).<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="utilities_printreposettings"></a>PrintRepoSettings.bat</h3>
    Prints out values of the environment variables that are relevant
    (contain parameter values) for scripts that update or clone
    repositories.<br>
    <b>Usage</b>:<br>
    <blockquote><i>PrintRepoSettings.bat<br>
      </i>
      <blockquote>Just prints out (to the console) values of environment
        variables that are used to define parameters for repository
        updates (e.g. by the <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i> script). See
        description of <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i> for description of the
        relevant environment variables carrying update parameters.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <i><i>PrintRepoSettings</i>.bat EmbeddedCommand &lt;arg 1 arg 2
        ....&gt;</i><br>
      <blockquote>Prints out values of the environment variables
        relevant for repository updates (in the same way as when calling
        the script without arguments, such as above), but in addition to
        that, the script runs the command <i>EmbeddedCommand</i>,
        passing to it all the eventual remaining arguments (the optional
        arguments <i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>, etc.).<br>
        Typically the <i>EmbeddedCommand</i> will be a script that also
        sets the environment variables related to repository updating. <br>
        The <i>EmbeddedCommand</i> is <b>run within a setlocal /
          endlocal block</b>, therefore <b>no side effects</b> will
        propagate to the calling environment.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <i></i></blockquote>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="utilities_setvar"></a>SetVar.bat</h3>
    Sets the value of the specified environment variable. The script
    requires at least two arguments, of which the first one is the name
    of the environment variable and the second one is the value to be
    assigned to this variable. The value assigned will persist in the
    calling environment.<br>
    Beside variable name and value, the script can <b>optionally</b>
    take <b>further arguments</b>, which in this case define an <b>embedded



      command with eventual arguments</b> executed recursively within
    the script. The embedded command (when defined) is <b>executed
      after the specified variable value is assigned</b>, and <b>any
      side effects of the embedded command are propagated</b> to the
    calling environment. This enables recursive chaining with other
    commands (e.g., as in example with <i>UpdateRepo.bat </i>script
    mentioned in script description) or setting multiple variables by a
    single command-line, e.g.:<br>
    <blockquote><i><u>SetVar</u> CloningDirectory "D:\My Repositories" <u>SetVar</u>
        RepoAddress
        https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.modules.IGLibScripts.git</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <b>Usage</b>:<br>
    <blockquote><i>SetVar.bat VariableName ValueAssigned</i><br>
      <blockquote>Assigns the value <i>ValueAssigned</i> to environment
        variable named <i>VariableName</i>. In line with Windows script
        rules, the parameters must be embedded in double quotes if they
        contain spaces.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <i>SetVar.bat VariableName ValueAssigned </i><i>EmbeddedCommand
        &lt;arg 1 arg 2 ....&gt;</i></blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>The same as above, but in addition the <i>EmbeddedCommand



        </i> is also executed recursively, receiving the eventual
        remaining arguments (the optional <i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>,
        etc.)<br>
        The <i>EmbeddedCommand</i> is <b><i>executed after the
            variable is assigned</i></b>. In his way, the recursively
        executed command can already make use of the newly assigned
        value of the environment variable&nbsp;<i>VariableName</i> that
        had been assigned by the script.<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="utilities_runlocal"></a>RunLocal.bat</h3>
    Executes the specified command or script in a local context
    (embedded in the setlocal / endlocal block), such that any changes
    in definitions or values of environment variables that the command
    may cause are not propagated to the calling environment.<br>
    For exemple, if you run the following command in the console window:<br>
    <blockquote><i>RunLocal SetVar xy NewValue</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    the <i>SetVar</i> script will set the value of the environment
    variable named <i>xy</i> but the effect will only be local (limited
    to the <i>RunLocal</i> script) and the assignment will not persist
    in the calling environment after the call. This can be verified by
    running<br>
    <blockquote><i>set xy</i><i> </i><br>
    </blockquote>
    or <br>
    <blockquote><i>echo %xy%</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    in the same console window after running the above command. On the
    contrary, when running <i>SetVar</i> script directly, i.e.:<br>
    <blockquote><i>SetVar xy NewValue</i></blockquote>
    &nbsp;the variable <i>xy</i> will actually be defined in the
    calling environment after the call and its value will be&nbsp;<i>NewValue</i>,
    as expected.<br>
    <br>
    At first glance this does not seem like a very useful functionality,
    however, it may be quite valuable when testing the scripts similar
    to those contained&nbsp; in the IGLibScripts repository, or in case
    of these scripts, also to contain side effects of scripts that do
    something but also have unintentional side effects.<br>
    <br>
    For example, several scripts described in this document can
    recursively run embedded commands that can be specified via
    additional command-line arguments that follow those that are
    requested (if any). Batch scripts of the Windows command shell are
    rather limited in how command-line arguments can be processed within
    scripts (e.g. in the number of arguments that can be referenced by
    consecutive numbers, like %1, %2, etc., limited to 9; or the ways
    how arbitrary groups of command-line arguments can be passed on to
    commands run recursively). In order to evade some of these
    limitations we needed to define auxiliary variables used to assemble
    command-lines for recursive commands, and in some scripts this
    cannot be done within <i>setlocal</i> / <i>endlocal</i> block
    because some side effect need to propagate to the calling
    environment. Therefore, when recursively chaining several commands,
    it may sometimes make sens to break propagation of side effect at
    some point in hierarchy, and this can be achieved by using the <i>RunLocal.bat</i>
    script.<br>
    <br>
    The other usage is in testing. Some scripts have intended side
    effects, such as <i>SetScriptReferences.bat</i> or <i>SetVar..bat</i>.
    Sometimes when troubleshooting issues ans debugging or testing such
    scripts in a console, we want to run them in sequences but want to
    preserve intact environment between successive calls, such that each
    group of tests would run under the same conditions (without having
    specific variables set by these scripts before running the next
    test). The <i>SetLocal</i> script may come handy in such
    situations.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Usage</b>:<br>
    <blockquote><i>SetLocal.bat </i><i>EmbeddedCommand &lt;arg 1 arg 2
        ....&gt;<br>
      </i>
      <blockquote>Executes the command <i>EmbeddedCommand</i>, passing
        it the optional command-line arguments when defined (the
        optional arguments <i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>, etc.), within the
        <i><b>setlocal</b></i> / <i><b>endlocal</b></i> block, such
        that changes such as environment variables defined or changed by
        the script are not propagated to the calling environment.<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="utilities_setscriptreferences"></a>SetScriptReferences.bat</h3>
    Sets a set of predetermined environment variables to the paths of
    the current locally cloned <i>IGLibScripts</i> repository and some
    commonly used scripts within that are included in the repository.
    The assignment of environment variables defined by the script
    propagate back to the caller's environment.<br>
    <br>
    This script is commonly used in bootstrapping scripts, which take
    care that the <i>IGLibScripts</i> is cloned at known location such
    that its scripts can be used. There are several advantages in
    putting script paths into environment variables. The scripts can in
    this way be run in shorter form, e.g.:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><u>"%UpdateRepo%"</u> .\SettingsIGLibCore <u>"%SetVar%"</u>
      ModuleDir ..\modules\IGLibCore</i><br>
    <br>
    The second advantage is that reasonable attempts will be made that
    names of these meaningful variables will remain unchanged, while
    relative locations of the corresponding scripts within the <i>IGLibScripts</i>
    repository or script names may change often.<br>
    If a location within the <i>IGLibScripts</i> repository or name of
    a certain script would change, the <i>SetScriptReferences.bat</i>
    would be updated accordingly to reflect the new path (if not, this
    would be a bug). In case that some variable name is found strange
    and would be changed, the previous name can still remain set in the
    script for some time.<br>
    <br>
    The following environment variables are defined by the script:<br>
    <blockquote><i><b>IGLibScripts</b></i> is set to the absolute path
      path of the cloned <i>IGLibScripts</i> repository from which the
      batch script was called.<br>
      <i><b>UpdateRepo</b></i> is set to the full absolute path of the
      script <i>UpdateRepo.bat</i> contained in the locally cloned <i>IGLibScripts</i>
      repository from which the <i>SetScriptReferences</i> script was
      called.<br>
      <i><b>SetVar</b></i> is set to the absolute path of the <i>SetVar.bat</i>
      script.<br>
      <i><b>PrintRepoSettings</b></i> is set to the absolute path of the
      <i>PrintRepoSettings.bat</i> script. <br>
      <i><b>SetScriptReferences</b></i> is set to the absolute path of
      the <i>SetScriptReferences.bat</i> script.<br>
      <i><b>PrintScriptReferences</b></i> is set to the absolute path of
      the <i>PrintScriptReferences.bat</i> script.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="utilities_printscriptreferences"></a>PrintScriptReferences.bat<br>
    </h3>
    Prints values of environment variables that are set by <i>SetScriptReferences.bat</i>.<br>
    <b>Usage</b>:<br>
    <blockquote><i>PrintScriptReferences.bat<br>
      </i>
      <blockquote>Just prints the values of environment variables that
        are set by the <i>SetScriptReferences</i> script.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <i><i>PrintScriptReferences</i>.bat </i><i>EmbeddedCommand
        &lt;arg 1 arg 2 ....&gt;</i><i></i><br>
      <blockquote>Beside printing the variables as described above, this
        also executes the command <i>EmbeddedCommand</i>, passing it
        the optional command-line arguments when defined (the optional
        arguments <i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>, etc.). The command is
        executed before printing of variables is performed. This can be
        used e.g. to run the <i>SetScriptReferences</i> script, which
        sets the variables, before they are printed. Execution of the <i>EmbeddedCommand</i>
        is performed within the <i><b>setlocal</b></i> / <i><b>endlocal</b></i>
        block, such that changes such as environment variables defined
        or changed by the command are not propagated to the calling
        environment. This is particularly useful for testing.<br>
