TO DO:

Consider whether the bootstrapping scripts can be simplified!

Currently, the bootstrapping directory contains scripts that are sufficient
to perform the updating job.

This should not be needed, in fact these scripts should only need to make sure
to clone and simply update the IGLibScripts and then call into that repository
to delegate real work there. 

See e.g. how binaries repo is updated in codedoc repository, in GenerateCodeDoc
script (though there is a deficiency because it is not possible to tell the
script which branch / commit to check out).
