This directory contains some module uppdating scripts that were initially 
located in the IGLib's directory workspace/scripts/, and are now obsolete.

The scripts at the original location will still be in use until all
locations are updated to the new scripts from this repository, and are
available directly at the workspace/scripts/ location in the IGLib's
container repository.

Scripts duplicates are temporarily stored at this location because the
current repository is the original source of these scripts, and this
location serves as temporary backup of the scripts for the time when
the obsolete scripts are still in use at some locations.

The newer approach is to use scripts in the root of this repository, such
as UpdateRepo.bat, in order to clonee and update modules within the
IGLib's directory sttructure.
